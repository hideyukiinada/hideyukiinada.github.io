# About me

My name is Hide Inada.  I enjoy learning and playing with mathematics & machine learning.  I have been writing code for a good chunk of my adult life.   My first programming language was C, but for the past 8 years, I have been programming mostly in Python.  I also have experience in mobile software development using Objective-C.

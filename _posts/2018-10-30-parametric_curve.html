title: Parametric curve
---
A parametric curve is a very fascinating feature in math.<!--more-->
Unlike a scalar-valued function such as \(y=f(x)\), a parametric curve can output multiple values 
such as x and y where y is a function of t and x is another function of t. 
Therefore, x and y can move independently from each other on the xy-coordinate enabling us to produce 
a curve that is not possible by \(y=f(x)\). For example, \(\vec{r}(t) = \langle cos(2t), sin(t) \rangle \) 
  is a vector-valued function that goes back and forth on the same path. I created a video clip to illustrates this.
